Hey <%= @referral.first_name %>!
Your buddy <%= @referral.user.full_name %> has invited you to be part of the Quick Favor Club!

A little about us...


We started the Quick Favor Club on the premise of Adam Grant's "five-minute favor", popularized in his bestselling book <%= link_to "Give and Take", "https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take" %>.
The idea behind these quick favors is simple: we can all find ways of adding high value to othersâ€™ lives at a low personal cost.

Our network is an invite-only community of do'ers that believe in helping others conveniently but impactfully.
This philosophy and behavior is contagious, and by paying it forward, the return on a favor fulfilled could be exponential.

To join us, please sign up at <%= link_to "this link", "https://quick-favor-club.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up" %> and be sure to list <%= @referral.user.full_name %> as your referrer.
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to drop a note to this email.

We're excited to have you be part of our community!

Cheers,
The Quick Favor Team
