  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-center">About Us</h4>

  <p class="text-center mt-4 mx-3">
  We started the Quick Favor Club on the premise of Adam Grant's "five-minute favor", popularized in his bestselling book <%= link_to "Give and Take", "https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take" %>.
  The idea behind these <i>quick</i> favors is simple: we can all find ways of adding high value to othersâ€™ lives at a low personal cost.
  </p>

  <p class="text-center">
  Our network is an <strong>invite-only community of do'ers that believe in helping others <i>conveniently</i> but <i>impactfully</i></strong>.
  This philosophy and behavior is contagious, and by paying it forward, the return on a favor fulfilled could be exponential.
  </p>
